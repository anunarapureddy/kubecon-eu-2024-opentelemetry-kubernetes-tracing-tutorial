# Exploring the Power of Distributed Tracing with OpenTelemetry on Kubernetes

This repository hosts content for tutorial for Kubecon EU 2024 Paris.

__Abstract__: Rolling out an observability solution is not a straightforward problem. There are many solutions and the final architecture can impact the effectiveness, robustness, and long-term maintenance aspects of the architecture. In this comprehensive tutorial, we will deploy an end-to-end distributed tracing stack on Kubernetes using the OpenTelemetry project. The tutorial will cover both manual and auto-instrumentation, extending the auto-instrumentation, collecting data with the OpenTelemetry collector and performing transformation on spans using OTTL, tail-based sampling, deriving metrics from traces, tracing with proxies/service meshes and collecting traces from Kubernetes infrastructure. After this session, the audience will be able to understand and use OpenTelemetry API/SDK, auto-instrumentation, collector, and operator to roll out a working distributed tracing stack on Kubernetes.
